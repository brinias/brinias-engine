Of course! Adding the example equation is a fantastic idea. It makes the abstract concept of "symbolic regression" very real and tangible for anyone visiting your repository.

I have integrated the new section into the `README.md` you provided. I also took the liberty of making a few minor formatting and consistency improvements to make it even clearer for new users.

Here is the complete, updated `README.md`. You can replace the entire content of your existing file with this.

# Brinias: Symbolic Modeling Engine

Brinias is a powerful Python library that uses Genetic Programming to automatically discover mathematical formulas that model your data. It can be used for both regression (predicting a number) and classification (predicting a category) tasks.

The key output is a simple, human-readable mathematical equation that represents the learned model.

### Core Features

*   **Symbolic Regression & Classification:** Finds the underlying formula in your data.
*   **Automated Feature Preprocessing:** Handles numerical, categorical, and text data automatically.
*   **Simple API:** Train a model and make predictions with just two main functions.
*   **Portable Models:** Exports the final formula into a standalone Python file (`generated_model.py`) that can be used anywhere without needing the `brinias` library.
*   **Transparent & Interpretable:** The final model is a clear equation, not a black box.

## What is the Output? An Example Equation

Unlike traditional "black box" models (like deep neural networks), the primary output of `Brinias` is a mathematical formula. This formula represents the best model found to describe the relationship between your features and the target.

For example, after running on the Ethereum price data, `Brinias` might discover a formula like this:

```
safe_exp(protected_log(sub(sub(sub(sub(sub(sub(Close, -1.408225548256985), cos(Close)), cos(sub(Close, sin(Open)))), safe_tan(cos(Close))), cos(sub(Close, sin(Open)))), cos(sub(Close, sin(Open))))))
```

This raw output uses protected functions (e.g., `protected_log` to avoid errors) and shows the exact combination of features (`Close`, `Open`) and mathematical operations (`sub`, `cos`, `safe_exp`) that form the predictive model. This equation is then compiled into the final portable Python model.

## 1. Installation

To get started, you need `git` and `python >= 3.7` installed on your system.

**Strongly recommended to create a virtual environment before using it:**
 ```bash
# Create the virtual environment
python3 -m venv .venv

# Activate it (macOS/Linux)
source .venv/bin/activate

# Activate it (Windows)
# .\.venv\Scripts\activate
```

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    Open your terminal and clone the project from its repository.
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/brinias/brinias-engine.git
    cd brinias-engine # Navigate into the project's root directory
    ```

2.  **Install the Library:**
    Install the library in "editable" mode. This allows you to make changes to the source code and have them immediately apply without reinstalling.
    ```bash
    pip install -e .
    ```
    This command reads the `setup.py` file and installs `brinias` along with all its dependencies.

You are now ready to use the library!

## 2. The Main Workflow

Using `brinias` is a simple, two-step process:
1.  **Train a Model** on your dataset.
2.  **Make Predictions** using new data.

We will use the `examples/training.py` and `examples/predict.py` scripts as our guides.

### Step 1: Training a Model

The `train_model` function is the heart of the library. It takes your CSV data, finds the best formula, and saves all the resulting model files.

#### Example Training Script:
This code trains a model using the provided `dataeth.csv` dataset.

```python
# From examples/training.py
from brinias import train_model

print("--- STARTING MODEL TRAINING ---")

train_model(
    csv_path="examples/dataeth.csv",
    target_column="next_close",
    output_dir="next_close_model", # Give the model a descriptive name
    generations=120,
    pop_size=100,
    show_plot=True
)

print("--- TRAINING COMPLETE ---")
```
When you run this, `brinias` will start the evolutionary process, printing the progress for each generation.

#### What Happens After Training?
A new folder named **`next_close_model`** will be created. It contains everything needed to use your model:

*   `generated_model.py`: A standalone Python script containing your model's formula. **This is your portable model.**
*   `equation.txt`: A simple text file with the raw mathematical expression.
*   `vectorizers.pkl`, `label_encoder.pkl`, etc.: Helper files that store the data preprocessing steps.
*   `evolution_history.csv`: A log of the model's performance during training.

### Step 2: Making Predictions

Once the model is trained, you can use the `make_prediction` function to predict outcomes for new, unseen data.

#### Example Prediction Script:

```python
# From examples/predict.py
from brinias import make_prediction

print("--- MAKING A NEW PREDICTION ---")

# The dictionary keys MUST match the column names from your training CSV
new_data_point = {
   "timestamp": "2025-05-14",
   "Open": 2679.71,
   "High": 2725.99,
   "Low": 2547.26,
   "Close": 2609.74,
   "Volume": 830047.1122,
}

# Point to the folder created during training
prediction = make_prediction(
    input_data=new_data_point,
    model_dir="next_close_model"
)

print("\n--- Prediction Result ---")
print(prediction)
```
The function will return a dictionary containing the prediction, for example: `{'prediction_type': 'regression', 'predicted_value': 2650.75}`.


## 3. Troubleshooting

*   **`ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'brinias'`**: Make sure you ran `pip install -e .` from the project's root directory and that your virtual environment is active.
*   **`FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'my_data.csv'`**: Check that the `csv_path` in `train_model` is correct. The path is relative to where you run the python command.
*   **`ValueError: Input data is missing expected column: 'Some_Column'`**: The dictionary you pass to `make_prediction` must contain a key for *every single feature column* that was in your original training CSV (except the target).

## ðŸ“Š Benchmark Results

To demonstrate the effectiveness of `Brinias`, a fair benchmark was conducted against several standard regression models. The goal is to predict the `next_close` price of Ethereum.

### Performance Metrics

The table below shows that **Brinias achieved the lowest Mean Squared Error (MSE) and the highest RÂ² Score**, indicating the most accurate and reliable predictions on the test set.

| Model               | Time (s)   | MSE         | RÂ² Score |
|---------------------|------------|-------------|----------|
| **Brinias**         | `244.17`   | `5972.45`   | `0.4801` |
| Linear Regression   | `0.00`     | `6161.01`   | `0.4637` |
| XGBoost             | `0.17`     | `7319.93`   | `0.3628` |
| Random Forest       | `0.15`     | `7394.59`   | `0.3563` |

### Visual Comparison

### Conclusion

Even on a challenging dataset, **Brinias successfully discovered a symbolic formula that outperformed standard machine learning models.** Its ability to find complex, non-linear relationships makes it a powerful tool for financial time-series analysis and other regression tasks where interpretability and accuracy are paramount.
